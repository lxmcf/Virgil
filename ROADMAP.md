<h1 align="center">Roadmap</h1>

This road map is a **rough** outline of my plans for Virgil's milestone releases and in no way is set in stone...
This is all wishful thinking, who know's if I'll ever hit 1.0

### Version 1.0
---
- Based on SDL2 using Vala
- Contains basic framework to develop 2D games
- No networking functionality
- C header's
- Potential GTK based IDE

### Version 2.0
---
- Based on OpenGL and using GLFW3 or GTK3/4 (Removal of SDL2 dependencies)
- Extended 2D support (OpenGL shaders, better hardware acceleration)
- Better support for other programming languages (D, C#, ETC)
- Multi-threading support (Likely using Vala's multi-threading)

### Version 3.0
---
- Better MacOS support (Metal)
- Better mobile support
- Potential basic 3D support
- [YABBY](https://github.com/lxmcf/yabby) build system support

### Version 4.0
---
- Maybe rewrite in C?
- Vulkan support

### Version 69.420
- Windows support ;-)
